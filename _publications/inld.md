title: "A Framework for Interactive Natural Language Debugging"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/inld
excerpt: "Natural language systems that use hand-curated linguistic resources have advantages over Machine
Learning systems in that their behavior can be examined and incrementally corrected. However,
maintaining these systems is a challenge due to the amount of expertise required and the complexity
of the debugging process. To address this challenge, we propose Interactive Natural Language
Debugging (INLD), a framework for locating and correcting errors in a systemâ€™s linguistic resources
by interacting with a user in natural language. As part of ongoing research, we present the INLD
pipeline, a taxonomy of error types, and a formulation of INLD as a model-based diagnosis problem."
