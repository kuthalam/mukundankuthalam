Hello! My name is Mukund and I am currently on the industry-side job market with the ABD status and 2 Masters degrees: 1 in ML and 1 in KRR. I also happen to have the ABD status and my research interest is in natural language and reasoning. I received a Bachelor's in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Texas at Austin and 2 Masters in Computer Science from the Georgia Institute of Technology and Northwestern University. You can contact me at: mkuthalam@gmail.com.

As for my free time, I am usually watching anime, reading novels, playing/watching basketball, or playing video games.
