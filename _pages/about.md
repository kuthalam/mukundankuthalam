Hello! My name is Mukund and I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate at Northwestern University (NU). I joined the Qualitative Research Group (QRG) led by Dr. Ken Forbus in Fall 2020, and my research interest is in question answering and commonsense, as explored through textual data. I received a Bachelor's in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Texas at Austin and a Masters in Computer Science from the Georgia Institute of Technology. You can contact me at: mukundan@u.northwestern.edu.

As for my free time, I am usually watching anime, reading novels, playing/watching basketball, or playing video games.
